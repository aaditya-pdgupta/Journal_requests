# Journal_requests

I was offered to work on various journals across the globe. I got an invitation to work as a part-time editor from EditSprings. It was an remunerated 
position. I also got an opportunity to participate as a Board member for the International Journal of Clinical Case Reports and Reviews. However, I 
did not accept any offers because my qualifications are till high school only, and it would create added pressure during this early phase of my life.
Besides, I received many emails to publish the preprints in the journal with high impact factors and various offers to write short reviews on topics
related to biological research. The pdf of all the requests was uploaded to the Github repository named Journal_requests.
